                <p><em>Current Student at <a href="https://seidenberg.pace.edu/computer-science-ms">Pace University</a></em></p>
                <p> My passion for coding and computer programming brought me to the heart of New York City
                    at Pace University. At Pace University, there are more resources available to me than I
                    could've imagined. The diversity of students and different teaching methods available here
                    has made me a better student. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics.
                    And it was at Pace University that I learned how much there was yet to learn. Now as I'm getting
                    ready to get into the industry, there's certainly more to learn and even more problems to solve,
                    and more to build.
